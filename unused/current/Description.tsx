<span>Chevy has been in our program for a few years now as he needs to go to that perfect home that understands&nbsp;him and his needs.&nbsp; You see, Chevy is a working/herding breed of dog and was on his own to fend for himself for so long on the rough streets of Houston that he's leery of people until he gets to know you.&nbsp; Chevy had been living under a truck for a while (it was a Chevy) while a Scout's Honor volunteer was working to gain his trust. He kept going every day to feed him and give him some attention. The business near where he was let him come onto their property and provided him some shelter.&nbsp; Unfortunately, because there was a busy street nearby, Chevy got bumped by a few cars when he was out and about and lost a few teeth as a result.&nbsp; Luckily, he did not sustain any significant injuries, and just needed to eat and get a bath.&nbsp;</span>

    &nbsp;He is a high&nbsp;energy dog, but is also very smart and alert.&nbsp;He needs A LOT of exercise and positive reinforcement, but will pick&nbsp;up very quickly on what you are teaching him. He would be a great dog for agility or flyball!!&nbsp; As&nbsp;long as you keep him busy and challenged he will impress you with how well he can learn things. He just wants someone who will give him the direction, attention and structure he&nbsp;wants/needs. He would make a great dog for an active home with NO kiddos.&nbsp; Kiddos are just too unpredictable for this guy.&nbsp; He also needs a home that understands how to properly introduce him to new people and watch his cues.&nbsp; Chevy can be very protective of his people and area, so proper intros are a must.&nbsp; He would do best in a home that does not have a lot of new people coming in/out.<br/>
<br/>
True to his Kelpie/Basenji breed, Chevy likes to herd and run and play</span>
